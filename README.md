# BMI-Analysis
A text file with alternate height and weight is provided. Each pair of numbers in the file is a record for one person. For example, the first pair is
(180, 180); it means the height is 180 cm and weight is 180 lb for person-1. The 2nd pair is (170, 200);
it means the height is 170 cm and the weight is 200 lb for person-2 and so on.

We use height and weight to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a person. The following formula
is used to calculate the BMI:
BMI = kg/m2
As you have seen in the text file, the heights and weights are given in cm and lb respectively, so before
we can apply the formula to do the calculation, we have to convert the height and weight to kilogram
and meter respectively. Please use 1 kg = 2.2lbs and 1 meter = 100 cm
Once the BMI is calculated then we use the result to determine whether a person has normal weight
or underweight or overweight or obese. We use the following to calculate the BMI category based on
the calculated BMI:
BMI Categories:
Underweight = <18.5
Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
Overweight = 25–29.9
Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater

The derived information is then presented in a certain way so that we can gather more information about the various BMI groups.
